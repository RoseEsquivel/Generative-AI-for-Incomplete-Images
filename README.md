# GAN for Missing Pixels in Images



 This is a computer vision and pattern recognition oriented generative adversarial network designed to inference on incomplete images and generate the missing pixels based on resaerch of [Zheng et al. (2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04227).

The next interation would be to attach Meta's [I-JEPA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ijepa/tree/main) architecture as described by [Assran et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08243) to the generative header thus improve inference capabilites. Hopefully, when the inference is learning highly semantic image representations without relying on hand-crafted data-augmentations, we can get better generative AI performance in the generation of hands and fingers, which has thus far been my weakest performing test by far. This specific area seems to be an industry wide issue impacting even the best generative AI models, so any improvement is significant and worth publishing.
